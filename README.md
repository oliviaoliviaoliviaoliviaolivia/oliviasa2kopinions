<h1> Cheese. </h1>

Cheddar cheese is arguably the worst food to exist. Most people don't think about the fact that cheese is expired milk, but after eating the terrible, oddly-orange, fear-inspiring horror of cheddar cheese, it's all you can think about. 

<h1> Apples. </h1>

The only apple truly worth eating are Gala apples. Not too sweet, not too bitter, and with the perfect crunch, Gala apples are the absolute perfect apple to ever exist, and all other apples should just stop growing.

<h1>The best word to exist.</h1>

The best word ever made is petrichor. It just rolls off the tongue, and it's meaning and sound match up perfectly, and it's overall a wonderful word.

<h1>Boba. </h1>

Boba is arguably the worst drink ever created, and every single club that sells it at the front of school should stop and think about what they are doing. It's so bad, I would even say its worse than drinking tea.
